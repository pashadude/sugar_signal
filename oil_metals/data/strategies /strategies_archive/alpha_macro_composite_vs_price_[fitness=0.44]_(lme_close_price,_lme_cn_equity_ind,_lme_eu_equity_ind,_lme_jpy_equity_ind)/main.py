    Hypothesis: Computes an alpha factor based on the composite macroeconomic indicators versus the price trend.

    This function calculates the average of three macroeconomic indicators (lme_cn_equity_ind, lme_eu_equity_ind, lme_jpy_equity_ind),
    determines the trend of this average, and compares it to the lagged price trend of a commodity (lme_close_price).
    The hypothesis is that the divergence between macroeconomic trends and commodity price trends can be predictive of future price movements."""
